Current Status
==============
This library has now reached "Production" status.  


Tested on the following platforms
=================================
Linux/AMD64     GCC 4.1.2
FreeBSD/i386    GCC 3.4.6 and 4.3.3
Windows XP      MS Visual C++ 8.0


Notes
=====
Some version of GCC (3.4.x and probably some of 4.x series too) on Windows
(both Mingw and Cygwin) produces lots of warnings of the form "warning: inline
function 'void foo()' is declared as dllimport: attribute ignored." This can
be worked around by adding -Wno-attributes option to GCC command.
Unfortunatelly, not all affected version of GCC have this option.
